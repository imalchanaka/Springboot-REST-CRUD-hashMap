This code appears to be a Java application built using the Spring Framework to create a
simple Employee Management system. Let's break down the technologies and provide a brief introduction:

1. **Java**: The code is primarily written in Java, which is a widely-used programming language.

2. **Spring Framework**: This application is built using the Spring Framework, which is a popular
framework for building Java-based enterprise applications. It provides various modules for handling different aspects
of application development, including web applications.

3. **Spring Boot**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the code, Spring Boot is commonly used with Spring Framework
for building stand-alone, production-ready Spring-based applications. It simplifies the configuration and deployment process.

4. **RESTful API**: The application uses RESTful principles to create a web service for managing employee data.
It exposes endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records.

5. **RestController**: This annotation is used in the `employeeController` class to define it as a controller
 that handles HTTP requests and returns JSON responses. It's part of Spring MVC for building RESTful web services.

6. **@GetMapping, @PostMapping, @DeleteMapping**: These annotations are used to map HTTP GET, POST, and DELETE requests
to specific methods in the controller class, defining the API endpoints.

7. **@CrossOrigin**: This annotation allows cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), which enables the
 client-side code from different domains to make requests to this API.

8. **@RequestBody**: This annotation is used to indicate that a method parameter should be bound
to the body of the HTTP request. It's used in the `addEmployee` method to parse the request body
and create an `Employee` object.

9. **Model Class (`Employee`)**: The `Employee` class represents the model for employee data.
 It has fields for name, employee ID, and salary, along with getter and setter methods.

10. **EmployeeService**: This class is a simple service layer that manages employee data.
It uses a `HashMap` (`empStore`) to store employee records and provides methods for retrieving all employees, adding employees, and deleting employees.

In summary, this code is a basic example of a RESTful API built with the Spring Framework for managing employee data.
 It allows clients to perform CRUD operations on employee records by making HTTP requests to the specified endpoints.
  The code is a simplified example and lacks features like database integration, error handling, and proper RESTful
  conventions, but it serves as a starting point for understanding how to build a web service with Spring.
